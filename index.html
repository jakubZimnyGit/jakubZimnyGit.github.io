                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p> 
                    I am an IT student. I started learning programming in high school, encouraged by a friend, 
                    choosing python as my first programming language. I like algorithms and schemes,
                    so I found myself in programming. since then I continue to learn programming in C#.
                    I have been learning languages ​in schools for many years. I know the basics of German
                    and I have no problems communicating in English. I am a team player who learns quickly and has a good attitude.

                        <h3>Team sports</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've always liked team sports. I think it's a great way to spend free time with friends or relatives. 
                            I believe that team sports teach you to appreciate the value of every teammates abilities
                            and how their strengths can contribute to shared goal.

                        <h3>Cooking</h3>
                        <p>
                            although I'm not a great cook, I really enjoy cooking. 
                            It allows me to relax and feel creative. I like to experiment with dishes,
                            by changing the recipe and expecting the best outcome
                        </p>

                        <h3>Board games</h3>
                        <p>
                            I like board games that include competition and strategic thinking, such as "Catan".
                            I believe that board games allow us to develop and have fun at the same time

                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                        <p>
                            Programming combines many things that I like, such as analytical and creative thinking,
                            problem solving or research skills. I also love working with people and as a professional programmer
                            I will definitely have the opportunity to work in a team. that's why I'm motivated to learn in my free time
                            and gain my first professional experience in the industry as soon as possible.
                        </p>
